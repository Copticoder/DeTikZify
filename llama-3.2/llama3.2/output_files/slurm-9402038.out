You are a helpful AI that can generate tikz code from images.

This is a picture of a scientific figure  as well as its caption. The caption reads: '\small{For a solution in $Q_1$, we prove Hölder continuity \ref{thm:holder} in $Q_{\frac{1}{2}}$. The Intermediate Value Lemma \ref{thm:IVL} relates $Q_{r_0}$ to $Q^-_{r_0}$ in the past. The Weak Harnack inequality \ref{eq:weakH} relates $Q_{\frac{r_0}{2}}$ with $\tilde Q^-_{\frac{r_0}{2}}$ and the Not-so-Strong Harnack inequality relates $Q_{\frac{r_0}{4}}$ with $\tilde Q^-_{\frac{r_0}{4}}$ in the past. Note that all cylinders depend on the value of $s \in (0, 1)$.}'. Generate LaTeX code that draws this scientific figure using TikZ. Ensure that the LaTeX code is self-contained and does not require any packages except TikZ-related imports. Make sure the TikZ code accurately reflects the image details as much as possible. Make sure the Tikz code compiles with no errors and is syntactically correctMake sure the output is not more than 500 wordsDon't forget to include \usepackage{tikz}! Return your result in a ```latex code block.
