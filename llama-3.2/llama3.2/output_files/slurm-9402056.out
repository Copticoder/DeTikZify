This is a picture of a scientific figure  as well as its caption. The caption reads: '\small{For a solution in $Q_1$, we prove Hölder continuity \ref{thm:holder} in $Q_{\frac{1}{2}}$. The Intermediate Value Lemma \ref{thm:IVL} relates $Q_{r_0}$ to $Q^-_{r_0}$ in the past. The Weak Harnack inequality \ref{eq:weakH} relates $Q_{\frac{r_0}{2}}$ with $\tilde Q^-_{\frac{r_0}{2}}$ and the Not-so-Strong Harnack inequality relates $Q_{\frac{r_0}{4}}$ with $\tilde Q^-_{\frac{r_0}{4}}$ in the past. Note that all cylinders depend on the value of $s \in (0, 1)$.}'. Generate LaTeX code that draws this scientific figure using TikZ. Ensure that the LaTeX code is self-contained and does not require any packages except TikZ-related imports. Make sure the TikZ code accurately reflects the image details as much as possible. Make sure the Tikz code compiles with no errors and is syntactically correctMake sure the output is not more than 500 wordsDon't forget to include \usepackage{tikz}! Return your result in a ```latex code block.

The following TikZ code draws the figure as described in the image.

```latex
\documentclass{article}
\usepackage{tikz}

\begin{document}

\begin{tikzpicture}[scale=1.5]

\draw[blue,fill=blue,fill opacity=0.2] (-1.5,-0.5) rectangle (2.5,3.5);

\node[draw,red] at (-1.5,2.5) {$Q_1$};

\node[draw,orange] at (1.5,2.5) {$Q_{\frac{1}{2}}$};

\node[draw,purple] at (1.5,1.5) {$Q_{r_0}$};

\node[draw,orange] at (0.5,1.5) {$Q_{\frac{r_0}{2}}$};

\node[draw,purple] at (-1.5,1.5) {$Q^-_{r_0}$};

\node[draw,orange] at (-1.5,0.5) {$\tilde Q^-_{\frac{r_0}{2}}$};

\node[draw,purple] at (0.5,0.5) {$\tilde Q^-_{\frac{r_0}{4}}$};

\end{tikzpicture}

This code defines a TikZ picture with a blue rectangle representing the set $Q_1$. The smaller rectangles within $Q_1$ are colored red, orange, and purple, representing the sets $Q_{\frac{1}{2}}$, $Q_{r_0}$, and $Q_{\frac{r_0}{2}}$, respectively. The nodes labeled $Q^-_{r_0}$, $\tilde Q^-_{\frac{r_0}{2}}$, and $\tilde Q^-_{\frac{r_0}{4}}$ are also included in the diagram. The code uses the `draw` command to create the rectangles and the `fill` command to fill them with a light blue color. The `fill opacity` option is used to set the opacity of the fill color. The `scale` option is used to scale the entire diagram.
