This is a picture of a scientific figure  as well as its caption. The caption reads: '\small{For a solution in $Q_1$, we prove Hölder continuity \ref{thm:holder} in $Q_{\frac{1}{2}}$. The Intermediate Value Lemma \ref{thm:IVL} relates $Q_{r_0}$ to $Q^-_{r_0}$ in the past. The Weak Harnack inequality \ref{eq:weakH} relates $Q_{\frac{r_0}{2}}$ with $\tilde Q^-_{\frac{r_0}{2}}$ and the Not-so-Strong Harnack inequality relates $Q_{\frac{r_0}{4}}$ with $\tilde Q^-_{\frac{r_0}{4}}$ in the past. Note that all cylinders depend on the value of $s \in (0, 1)$.}'. Generate LaTeX code that draws this scientific figure using TikZ. Ensure that the LaTeX code is self-contained and does not require any packages except TikZ-related imports. Make sure the TikZ code accurately reflects the image details as much as possible.

The house has rabbits and chickens, with in total 35 heads and 94 feet, then how many rabbits and chickens are there respectively? After abstraction, only related numbers and variables remain, and it turns out that the object $Z$ has two equivalent inductive limits: $\textcolor[RGB]{255,0,0}{35X+94Y}$ and $\textcolor[RGB]{0,0,255}{aX+bX+ 4aY+2bY}$. By exploiting this equivalence of the two limits, we can compute the two numbers with algebra.

The price of stock $i$ in month $t$ is $p_{i,t}$. In this example, the three predictors used are: (1) the book-to-market ratio, (2) the earnings-to-market ratio, and (3) the profitability ratio. Importantly, the \cite{famafrench15} definition of profitability is not a function of prices, so there is no arrow between prices and profitability. The predictors are mapped into the normalized assets predictors, $z_{i,k,t}$. Then portfolio weights are formed as function of these normalized predictors.

The path root-to-leaf in $T_{(5,9,10)}$ given by $(7,2),(7,1,3),(7,1,4),\emptyset$ represents the extensions of $(5,9,10)$ containing also the $2$ and the $3$, but not containing $7$, $1$ or $4$. Note that the labels on the leaf vertices are the cardinals of the partition sets.

The set $C$ is the lighter gray annulus together with the darker gray compact set $K$ in the center. Squares indicate the points along the paths and dashed segments the jumps that we imagine occurring in between. The points $P$ and $Q$ show how a path can either start in $K$ or in the annular region. The point $R$ shows that a path contained in $C$ can have zero length. The path ending at $S$ shows that one can jump between points in $K$ - but must stop there. Finally, the path ending at $T$ depicts how a path that at some point leaves $K$ can never return - but can get very close. The first unrestricted jump of each path is bolded, and note that all the paths must be contained in the bounded set $V$ which is a ball containing the full figure.

Processing sample 79/442 - Caption: \textbf{A 2D example with a RealNVP\cite{realnvp} normalizing flow.} The image space $\X$ contains data points sampled from 5 Gaussians with different means. The prior distribution in the latent space $\Z$ is Gaussian. Given a normalizing flow that maps $\Z \rightarrow \X$, we tame the model to produce the same image space $\X$, apart from the middle Gaussian, which we wish to remove. (Each Gaussian represents a person, and we would like to forget one person.) (\textbf{Train}) Prior to our method, the inverse flow was trained to map points from $\X$ to $\Z$. To generate samples, the flow is used to map $\Z$ to $\X$. (\textbf{Forget}) We apply our method: latent vectors that were initially mapped to the center Gaussian now have a lower likelihood of being drawn from the prior distribution. (\textbf{Sample}) Now that we tamed the model, when we sample from $\Z$, the points are mapped (with high probability) to the 4 Gaussians.

In fact, let $[f(x)]_i=\sum_{j=1,2}\,w_{ij}\varphi(b_{ij}+x_j)$ with $\varphi$ denoting ReLU, then it is enough to set $w_{ij}=1$, $b_{1j}=1$, $b_{2j}=0$ and $g(y)=y_1-2y_2-1$ to get $g(f(x))=\varphi(1+x_1)+\varphi(1+x_2)-2\varphi(x_1)-2\varphi(x_2)-1$, which equals $1-|x_1|-|x_2|$ inside the square and is negative outside. On the contrary, it is easy to see that if $f$ was a standard fully connected layer, then for all choices of $f$ and $g$ the set where $g(f(x))\geq0$ would always be unbounded or empty.

Processing sample 131/442 - Caption: Aggregated results for the partial observability experiments with both occlusion types. For the experiments, except for the reward-only baseline, we used $20$ seeds per task. Both approaches clearly perform better than the reward-only baseline, showing that they can extract useful information from the occluded images. Yet, especially in the wall-occlusion task, the \emph{VRKN}-based agents outperform the \emph{RSSM}-based agents. They do not only achieve a higher reward but also converge faster. Especially in the wall occlusion task, it is insufficient to only extract information from the occluded images, but a reasonable belief also needs to be sustained over time.

By increasing the degree we can increase both the accuracy of the approximation and the range. In amplitude amplification settings, the singular value we want to amplify usually sits close to $0$, and we want to transform it as close as possible to $1$.

The red boxes and thick arrows show for example the ``correct path'' in which the index $\theta = \Theta(t)$ is proper at all time $t$. The ``correct path'' is expected to have the lowest values of both $\delta^\theta_t$ and $\Delta^\theta_t$.

Processing sample 175/442 - Caption: Reproduced Figure 1 of~\cite{OT08}. Each row of the qubits has the same number as the starting circuit. The number of rows is one more than the number of gates in the starting circuit. The $R$-th gate is performed on the $R$-th row and then all qubuts are swappwd with those in the $(R+1$)-th row. This lazy simulation of the circuit will ensure that each qubit is acted on by a gate at most three times.

For both types of agents, we find that proper inference by smoothing deteriorates performance. The additional epistemic uncertainty does not compensate for this decrease in performance.

Processing sample 328/442 - Caption: Sketch of the geometric setting of SW in GCC~\eqref{eq.baldauf}. The gravitational field $\mathbf{g}$ defines an equipotential surface $\mathcal{M}$. Thus, this surface is the manifold over which the problem is solved and it is fully described by the frame of GCC $\mathbf{x}=(x^1, x^2)$. The bathymetry is given by the bottom surface $b$, eventually discontinuous (meshed black surface). The free surface $\eta$ of the fluid is the blue surface. Consequently, the fluid depth $h$ is the length of the gravitational field line conducted from the free surface $\eta$ up to the bottom $b$. The velocity $\mathbf{u} = (u^1, u^2)$ of the fluid is computed along the tangent plane of the manifold $\mathcal{M}$ and measured along the principal directions given by the GCC $\mathbf{x}$.

Along the chain, all boundary words have length $\ri=7$. Above the line we have the critical words of the curves, and below the line the Farey fractions with corresponding boundary words [see theorems \ref{thm:CriticalCurves} ii) and \ref{thm:Words}]. The bottom row displays the critical words at the Farey points, all of length smaller than $7$, including the empty word $\varepsilon$ of zero length at $\theta^\pm$. The boundary word at a Farey point is the concatenation of a critical word and a periodic word, whose period is given by the denominator of the fraction.

Processing sample 364/442 - Caption: Visualization of the \textit{ProM}\optimization routine for the ACDC dataset with an acceleration factor of\texttt{x8} for a 2D mask. The \textbf{bottom row} shows our Bernoulli mask distribution $p_{\ensuremath{\bm{\theta}}}$, where a lighter color implies a higher probability for sampling the respective entry in the cartesian k-space grid. Starting from a randomly initialized distribution, \textit{ProM}\gradually optimizes$p_{\ensuremath{\bm{\theta}}}$ to maximize reconstruction quality while simultaneously increasing the sparsity of the masks. The resulting distribution converges to a domain-specific mask with desired acceleration factor that preserves most of the image's quality (\textbf{top row}). The original image is displayed on the \textbf{right}.

Processing sample 383/442 - Caption: An example of part of a brane tiling with the action of $\varphi$. Let $\varphi$ send the part of the brane tiling on the left to the part on the right. Take the generators of the orbits to be $a,\,b,\,c,\,d$ and write $p_i$ for the path in $\m CQ'$ made of isomorphism arrows between the vertices $i$ and $\varphi(i)$. Hence $\xi(\varphi(a)) = p_2 a p_1^{-1}$, $\xi(\varphi(b)) = p_3 b p_2^{-1}$, $\xi(\varphi(c)) = p_4 c p_3^{-1}$, and $\xi(\varphi(d)) = p_1 d p_4^{-1}$. Therefore $\xi(c_{\varphi(v)}) = \xi(\varphi(d)) \xi(\varphi(c)) \xi(\varphi(b)) \xi(\varphi(a)) = p_1 dcba p_1^{-1} = p_1 \xi(c_v) p_1^{-1}$ and all the intermediary paths of isomorphism arrows cancel, as required.

Panel (f) shows the same data as Figure \ref{fig:results-lineplot}. In the directedness ablation (a), both the curiosity-inducing locations and targets grow over time, with large variation. When cessation when satisfied is ablated (b), the values of both the curiosity-inducing location and the targets remain constant over time, with the value of the curiosity-inducing location reaching $0.315$ during the agent's first and only visit to the curiosity-inducing location at time $t=0$ and the value of the targets remaining $0$ throughout. The learned value for the ablations of voluntary exposure (c) and aversive quality (d) remains zero everywhere. When aversive quality is replaced with positive quality (e), the learned values for the curiosity-inducing location and the targets are similar to those in the original algorithm, but the value of the curiosity-inducing location grows slightly more quickly over time.

When an honest miner successfully mines a block, the deviant pool publishes its blocks, causing the block mined by the honest miner to be discarded, resulting in a slowdown.

Processing sample 424/442 - Caption: Here we illustrate the test spectrum of the relative majorization semiring $S^2$. It corresponds to the set of R\'{e}nyi divergences as is shown in the proof of Corollary~\ref{cor:RelativeMaj}, which is here drawn as the two-point compactification of $\R$. On the right-hand side of the centre point $\alpha=1/2$ (in black), we have the divergences $(p^{(1)},p^{(2)})\mapsto D_\alpha(p^{(1)}\|p^{(2)})$, and on the left-hand side of the centre point, we have the divergences $(p^{(1)},p^{(2)})\mapsto D_\alpha(p^{(2)}\|p^{(1)})$. Points $\alpha=0,1$ (in blue) correspond to the two essential derivations which are simply the Kullback-Leibler divergences with the two different orderings of its arguments, and the points $\alpha=\pm\infty$ (in red) correspond to the divergence $D_\infty$ with the two different orderings.
