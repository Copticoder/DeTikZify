This is a picture of a scientific figure. Generate LaTeX code that draws this scientific figure using TikZ. Ensure that the LaTeX code is self-contained and does not require any packages except TikZ-related imports. Don't forget to include \usepackage{tikz}! I understand that this is a challenging task, so do your best. Return your result in a ```latex code block.

Processing sample 1/442 - Caption: \small{For a solution in $Q_1$, we prove Hölder continuity \ref{thm:holder} in $Q_{\frac{1}{2}}$. The Intermediate Value Lemma \ref{thm:IVL} relates $Q_{r_0}$ to $Q^-_{r_0}$ in the past. The Weak Harnack inequality \ref{eq:weakH} relates $Q_{\frac{r_0}{2}}$ with $\tilde Q^-_{\frac{r_0}{2}}$ and the Not-so-Strong Harnack inequality relates $Q_{\frac{r_0}{4}}$ with $\tilde Q^-_{\frac{r_0}{4}}$ in the past. Note that all cylinders depend on the value of $s \in (0, 1)$.}

Processing sample 2/442 - Caption: The isotropic irradiation approximation. The starlight incidents on the dayside of the planet isotropically through the area $\pi R_p^2$. Due to atmospheric heat redistribution from dayside to nightside (shown in green arrow), the redistribution parameter is altered. The energy emitted from the dayside of a hot Jupiter decreases with the increase in the heat redistribution.
