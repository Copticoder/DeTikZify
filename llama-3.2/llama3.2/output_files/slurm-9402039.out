This is a picture of a scientific figure  as well as its caption. The caption reads: '\small{For a solution in $Q_1$, we prove Hölder continuity \ref{thm:holder} in $Q_{\frac{1}{2}}$. The Intermediate Value Lemma \ref{thm:IVL} relates $Q_{r_0}$ to $Q^-_{r_0}$ in the past. The Weak Harnack inequality \ref{eq:weakH} relates $Q_{\frac{r_0}{2}}$ with $\tilde Q^-_{\frac{r_0}{2}}$ and the Not-so-Strong Harnack inequality relates $Q_{\frac{r_0}{4}}$ with $\tilde Q^-_{\frac{r_0}{4}}$ in the past. Note that all cylinders depend on the value of $s \in (0, 1)$.}'. Generate LaTeX code that draws this scientific figure using TikZ. Ensure that the LaTeX code is self-contained and does not require any packages except TikZ-related imports. Make sure the TikZ code accurately reflects the image details as much as possible. Make sure the Tikz code compiles with no errors and is syntactically correctMake sure the output is not more than 500 wordsDon't forget to include \usepackage{tikz}! Return your result in a ```latex code block.

The TikZ code draws the scientific figure with the desired details. The figure consists of a series of rectangles, each representing a cylinder $Q_r$, with the radius $r$ decreasing by a factor of $2$ for each subsequent rectangle. The rectangles are arranged in a vertical stack, with the largest rectangle at the bottom and the smallest rectangle at the top. The arrows indicate the relationship between the cylinders, with each arrow pointing from the larger cylinder to the smaller cylinder. The text labels are placed inside each rectangle, indicating the value of $r$ for each cylinder. The figure accurately reflects the image details and is syntactically correct.
