**Step 1: Analyze the image**

The image depicts a diagram of a scientific figure, which appears to be related to mathematical concepts such as Hölder continuity, the Intermediate Value Lemma, and Harnack inequalities. The figure consists of several rectangles and cylinders, each labeled with a subscripted letter or symbol.

**Step 2: Identify the key elements**

The key elements in the image are:

*   A large rectangle labeled $Q_1$
*   A smaller rectangle labeled $Q_{\frac{1}{2}}$ inside $Q_1$
*   A cylinder labeled $Q_{r_0}$ above $Q_{\frac{1}{2}}$
*   A smaller cylinder labeled $Q^-_{r_0}$ inside $Q_{r_0}$
*   A rectangle labeled $Q_{\frac{r_0}{2}}$ below $Q_{\frac{1}{2}}$
*   A smaller rectangle labeled $\tilde Q^-_{\frac{r_0}{2}}$ inside $Q_{\frac{r_0}{2}}$
*   A rectangle labeled $Q_{\frac{r_0}{4}}$ below $Q_{\frac{r_0}{2}}$
*   A smaller rectangle labeled $\tilde Q^-_{\frac{r_0}{4}}$ inside $Q_{\frac{r_0}{4}}$

**Step 3: Write the TikZ code**

Here is the TikZ code that draws the scientific figure:

```latex

The isotropic irradiation approximation. The starlight incidents on the dayside of the planet isotropically through the area $\pi R_p^2$. Due to atmospheric heat redistribution from dayside to nightside (shown in green arrow), the redistribution parameter is altered. The energy emitted from the dayside of a hot Jupiter decreases with the increase in the heat redistribution.
Bifurcation for $B=0.1$. (Top): The color-coding indicates the position of the Dirac points for given values of $\alpha \in \mathbb R.$ The right figure illustrates the bifurcation at $\Gamma$ and the left figure at a non-equivalent (modulo $\Lambda^*$) bifurcation point that is a vertex of the boundary of the Brillouin zone, see Figure \ref{f:1}.
An example of $3$-ary cloning in the symmetric groups. Here we see that $(1~2~3)\varsigma_3^3 = (1~4~2~5~3)$. The arrow getting ``cloned'' is dashed, as are the three arrows resulting from the cloning.

Band structure of the continuum model Eq.~\eqref{eq_originalcontinuummodel} plotted along the high-symmetry path of the moir\'e mini-Brillouin zone illustrated in the inset. The bandwidth of the band closest to charge neutrality exactly vanishes when the coupling strength $\alpha = V_1 / |v q_0|$ reaches the value $\alpha^* \simeq 0.586$.
The principal optimally sets an interim deadline $t=S_{0}^{FI}$ under full information: given that the first stage of the project has not been completed by $S_{0}^{FI}$, it is optimal to stop investing at $S_{0}^{FI}$.

Penrose diagram of de Sitter space with the value of the (dimensionless) de Sitter invariant distance $Z(x,y)$ depicted, where the point $x$ is located in the lower left corner of the Penrose diagram. Further, $\bar x$ denotes the antipodal point. For instance, $Z(x,y)>1$ if the point $y$ lies in the Northern static patch.
An example for converting a classical problem of calculating the number of rabbits and chicken in a house, to a pure mathematical problem represented as a diagram. The house has rabbits and chickens, with in total 35 heads and 94 feet, then how many rabbits and chickens are there respectively? After abstraction, only related numbers and variables remain, and it turns out that the object $Z$ has two equivalent inductive limits: $\textcolor[RGB]{255,0,0}{35X+94Y}$ and $\textcolor[RGB]{0,0,255}{aX+bX+ 4aY+2bY}$. By exploiting this equivalence of the two limits, we can compute the two numbers with algebra.
An illustration of $f_F$. The vertical line segment $Q_0Q_3=\{\bx\}\times[0,b]$ intersects $S_i$ at $Q_i$, $i=0,\ldots,3$. The last coordinate of $f_F(Q_i)$ is $\varphi(Q_i)$. This figure is drawn with $r=3$.
Illustration of {\dcpriorityopt}. An optimal parity condition consistent with $(\F_0',\F_1')$ can redefine the priority of $q_0$ to $2$ and thus use one priority less.
Illustration of the substellar longitude, $\gamma$, and its relation to other angles and lines. Line IF is an inertial line and line PS is the line connecting the center of the star and the planet. The ellipse surrounding point P represents the planet's geometry as a triaxial ellipsoid. This figure is a recreation of Figure 2 of \citet{Gold1966} when a planet is near 1:1 synchronous rotation.

Structure of the used DNN. The number of nodes in the first and last layer are equal to the number of heat exchanges and estimated states in each test case. The hidden layers have 100, 250 and 250 Nodes in both cases.

Let $S_j$ denote the set of optimal first messages Alice could send in $\mathrm{Task}_j$. Then if two sets are disjoint, Alice would have to hedge her cheating attempts if Bob switches between those two tasks (e.g., $\mathrm{Task}_1$ and $\mathrm{Task}_2$). If the two sets have a nonempty intersection, Alice would have no difficulty cheating if Bob switches between those two tasks (e.g., $\mathrm{Task}_3$ and $\mathrm{Task}_4$).
Left: A stochastic context-free grammar (SCFG) and the associated positive polynomial system (PPS) which encodes the termination probabilities of each non-terminal, assuming production rules are taken uniformly at random. Right: The curves defined by the two equations. The least fixpoint (lfp) is $\approx (0.66,0.70)$. The thin colored area to the top right of the lfp is the set of inductive, i.e., self-certifying upper bounds on the lfp.
Inclusion diagram for graph classes discussed here (and related ones). If a class $A$ has an upward path to class $B$, then $A$ is included in $B$. For graphs in the gray classes, the complexity of \textsc{Isometric Path Cover}\xspace is open; for all other graph classes, it is NP-complete. For all shown graph classes, \textsc{Isometric Path Cover}\xspace is constant-factor approximable in polynomial time. Constant factor approximation algorithms for \textsc{Isometric Path Cover}\xspace on graph classes marked with \textbf{*} are contributions of this paper. % \ff{FF: strangely, the edge crossing below "circular-arc" is different (has a bend) from the ones below "circle".}
The dual graph for genus one degeneration, which is classified by Kodaira, see \cite{barth2015compact}. The data $(n_i,k_i, C_{ij})$ are read from the dual graph as follows: the number $n_i$ is listed for each component $C_i$ in the graph (if $n_i=1$, the number is omitted); $C_{ij}$ is read from the intersection number of component $C_i$ and $C_j$ in the graph; In genus one case, all the components are rational curve with $-2$ self-intersection number, and so $k_i=0$ for all the components.
Illustration of the strip $K_\Gamma^{(\hat{x})}$ (blue area) with $\hat{x} = (1, 0)$. Here the curve $a(t)=2\sqrt{2}(\cos t, -\sin t),\, t\in[\pi/4,3\pi/4]$ denotes the orbit (the red arc) of a point source moving from right to left. There holds $\inf(\hat{x}\cdot\, \Gamma) = -2, \,\sup(\hat{x}\cdot\, \Gamma) = 2,\,\xi_{\min}^{(\hat{x})}=3\pi/4-2,\,\xi_{\max}^{(\hat{x})}=\pi/4+2$. In this case the strip $K_\Gamma^{(\hat{x})}$ is a subset of $\{y\in{\mathbb R}^2: \hat{x}\cdot y\in \hat{x}\cdot \Gamma\}$.

Typical common tangent connection for the free energy densities for the interior $f^{\rm in}(\psi)$ (left) and exterior $f^{\rm out}(\psi)$ (right) \eqref{f_inout} phases. The vesicle will grow or shrink according to the initial (spatially uniform) states for $\psi$ inside and outside the vesicle. Suppose that $\psi^{\rm in}_{\star}$ and $\psi^{\rm out}_{\star}$ are the values of $\psi$ where the common tangent touches the respective free energy densities $f^{\rm in}(\psi)$ (left) and $f^{\rm out}(\psi)$ (right).
An example of a human contact multiplex network plus two different resources. The subgraph of virus $k$ in the human contact multiplex network together with resorces forms the graph $\mathcal{G(B^{\text{k}}_{\text{f}})}$, which is assumed to be strongly connected. The way that resources interact with different layers of the human contact network may also vary. We use different colours to highlight different types of diffusion due to different kinds of viruses.

The complete A.i.A.Co.\framework. In 1, a document containing the defence deeds is preprocessed, producing a text (2) that is then passed to a NLP model (3). In 4, the NLP model outputs the relevant features, that are then passed (5) to the predictive model, that outputs (6) the decision that is then proposed to the Judge. Weights learnt during the training of the predictive model are passed (7) to SHAP to produce explanations helping the Judge in using the proposed decision.
This picture shows a side by side comparison between the PODI and PA-POD. In PODI we interpolate accurate but scarce data, while with PA-POD we evaluate dense real time approximated data.

The fluid is subject to periodic boundary conditions at the (dash-dotted) side walls, homogeneous Dirichlet/Neumann conditions at the upper boundary $y=L_y$, and the no-slip condition at the wall $y=0$. In addition to the constant pressure gradient assumed to be present in the near-wall layer, the model includes a time-dependent, auxiliary forcing function $f$ (depicted here at multiple realizations in time) in a ``fringe region" $L_y/2 \le y \le L_y$ to make up for the momentum not transported at the computational boundary $y=L_y$.
A simplified model to estimate the penumbra size at a given pixel. We assume our occluder is spherical in shape, forming a convex bounding-sphere around the occlusion geometry as shown in figure (a) on the left. Figure (b) shows a simplified diagram to estimate the parameters $\theta, \theta_\delta$.

Example of the construction of the event $A_{St}$ for $q=0.7$ and $K=4$. The path containing the origin has level $-1$. If a point $(n,m)$ is in $C_{-1}$ or $C_1$, then we have $H(n+\frac{1}{2},m+\frac{1}{2})>1$ or $H(n+\frac{1}{2},m+\frac{1}{2})<-1$. The only face with height $-1$ on the $x$-axis of $\mathbb Z^2+(\frac{1}{2},\frac{1}{2})$ is $(-\frac{3}{2},\frac{1}{2})$. Therefore, the two blue points cannot be in the same finite cycle.

Schematic representation of the long-multiplet $\mathcal{L}_r$, see \cite{Kos:2018glc} for more details. The arrows going to the left (right) represent the action of $G^a_{-\frac{1}{2}}$ $\left(\bar{G}^b_{-\frac{1}{2}}\right)$. In the figure only the $SU(2)$ indices are shown. Operators in the same line have the same conformal dimension $h$ and the dimension grows by half when moving to the next line above.
Scaled PBC vectors $t\v{p}$, $s\v{p}_1$ and $r\v{p}_2$ obtained from a parameter search are shown. In order to find potentially better $s$ and $r$ scaling coefficients, a rotation is done around the vector $\v{p}$ by angle $\Delta \alpha$ of $\v{p}_1$ and $\v{p}_2$ to $\v{p}_1'$ and $\v{p}_2'$.
\textbf{Demand Mapping.} This figure shows how demand, for statistical arbitrageurs, is a function of prices and predictors. The price of stock $i$ in month $t$ is $p_{i,t}$. In this example, the three predictors used are: (1) the book-to-market ratio, (2) the earnings-to-market ratio, and (3) the profitability ratio. Importantly, the \cite{famafrench15} definition of profitability is not a function of prices, so there is no arrow between prices and profitability. The predictors are mapped into the normalized assets predictors, $z_{i,k,t}$. Then portfolio weights are formed as function of these normalized predictors.
Simulated boresight hit maps for one-month (left) and one-year (right) observations. The two panels share the same logarithmic color map, although the range shown is truncated for the one-month case. Unobserved pixels appear gray.
%Example of a embeddable word, with an embedding. Example~\ref{ex.1}. The edges are labelled with red. The edges with no label have the label $\emptyset$. The binomial numbers correspond to the number of extensions given by their root-to-leaf path, and the $k$ indicates the size of the extended edges. The path root-to-leaf in $T_{(5,9,10)}$ given by $(7,2),(7,1,3),(7,1,4),\emptyset$ represents the extensions of $(5,9,10)$ containing also the $2$ and the $3$, but not containing $7$, $1$ or $4$. Note that the labels on the leaf vertices are the cardinals of the partition sets. In this example, each set in $B_i$ has two vertices related to it, one of them being a leaf vertex, yet in general there may be more.

The relevant monotones on the preordered semiring $S^3$ in the sense of the \emph{test spectrum} of~\cite{Fritz2021b}. In green, we have the matrix $\mathuline{\alpha}$-divergences $D_{\mathuline{\alpha}}$ for $\mathuline{\alpha} \in (A_+ \cup A_-) \setminus \{e_1, \dots, e_d\}$ from~\eqref{eq:MatrDiv}. In red, we have the tropical quantities $D^\T_{\mathuline{\beta}}$ for $\mathuline{\beta} \in B_- \setminus \{0\}$, modulo scaling per Remark~\ref{rem:MatrTropNorm}. In blue, we have the derivation quantities $\Delta^{(k)}_{\mathuline{\gamma}}$ for nonzero $\mathuline{\gamma}$, also modulo scaling. The topology corresponds to the limits of Proposition~\ref{prop:MatrixDivLim}. In comparison with Figure~\ref{fig:d3}, the red tropical part can be thought of as points at infinity, specified by a direction $\mathuline{\beta} \in B_- \setminus \{0\}$, which serve as a compactification similar to points at infinity in the projective plane. The blue derivation part ``blows up'' every vertex in Figure~\ref{fig:d3} to a line.

The figure shows five different admissible paths at various points in $C$ represented by a white circle and ending at the points $P,Q,R,S$ and $T$. The set $C$ is the lighter gray annulus together with the darker gray compact set $K$ in the center. Squares indicate the points along the paths and dashed segments the jumps that we imagine occurring in between. The points $P$ and $Q$ show how a path can either start in $K$ or in the annular region. The point $R$ shows that a path contained in $C$ can have zero length. The path ending at $S$ shows that one can jump between points in $K$ - but must stop there. Finally, the path ending at $T$ depicts how a path that at some point leaves $K$ can never return - but can get very close. The first unrestricted jump of each path is bolded, and note that all the paths must be contained in the bounded set $V$ which is a ball containing the full figure.
Let red be the color $1$, and let blue be the color $2$. The above figure shows all the configurations with non-zero weights in the two-colored $t$-PNG model given by Definition \ref{def:nLmatrix}. Note that some of the configurations can be obtained from the two-colored S6V model by horizontal complementation of the red lines (i.e., deleting existing horizontal red lines and placing horizontal red lines where there aren't any). However, not all the configurations (e.g., the ones on the last row) can be obtained in this way.
Simulated versus asymptotic singular value and alignments corresponding to the first deflation step as per Theorem \ref{thm_first_deflation_step}. We considered $\beta_1 = 5$, $\alpha = 0.5$, $p=100$ and varying $\beta_1\in[0, 15]$. The system of equations in \eqref{eq_system_first_deflation} is solved numerically and initialized with the simulated singular value and alignments (dotted curves) from one realization of $\gT_1$.

\textbf{A 2D example with a RealNVP\cite{realnvp} normalizing flow.} The image space $\X$ contains data points sampled from 5 Gaussians with different means. The prior distribution in the latent space $\Z$ is Gaussian. Given a normalizing flow that maps $\Z \rightarrow \X$, we tame the model to produce the same image space $\X$, apart from the middle Gaussian, which we wish to remove. (Each Gaussian represents a person, and we would like to forget one person.) (\textbf{Train}) Prior to our method, the inverse flow was trained to map points from $\X$ to $\Z$. To generate samples, the flow is used to map $\Z$ to $\X$. (\textbf{Forget}) We apply our method: latent vectors that were initially mapped to the center Gaussian now have a lower likelihood of being drawn from the prior distribution. (\textbf{Sample}) Now that we tamed the model, when we sample from $\Z$, the points are mapped (with high probability) to the 4 Gaussians.

An illustration of Proposition \ref{prop : non-closed geodesics}. The non-closed geodesic $\gamma_{\rho_0}$ is damped by some polyhedron in the direction $\Xi_0^\perp \in F$. By density in $F$, it enters that polyhedron. The dashed violet edges and paler-shade part of the polyhedron are below the plane $F$. The dashed blue and red lines are inside the polyhedron.

The high-level \emph{threat model} of speech interaction, where a private message is sent through a channel to the legitimate recipient, but consequential side-information is bundled to that message. It is a threat to privacy when an undesired recipient gains access to that private message or side information (marked by red arrows and exclamation marks).
Equip the $1$-skeleton above with the factorization rule $c_2 b_1\sim e_1 a_2$ and $e_2 a_1\sim c_1 b_2 $ (the remaining relations are fixed). Notice that $w$ is fully reducible with color set red (dashed) and blue (dotted). If a smaller color set was chosen, notice that the first condition of Definition \ref{red} would not be satisfied. Observe that reduction cannot be performed in any obvious way. That is, removal of $b_1$ will remove only a single edge of the commuting square $c_2 b_1\sim e_1 a_2$. This means the resulting $1$-skeleton will not correspond to a $2$-graph.
$L^{\star}_{S}$, which is formulated with Schnorr randomness, is compatible with more worlds than $L^{\star}_{ML}$, which employs Martin-L\"of randomness. However, the two are empirically indistinguishable, if one is limited to Turing-strength computation.
Schematic diagram of two black holes generated at $\tau=0$ from pure dS. A topology change of the spatial section from an interval to a circle occurs with two copies of global de Sitter spaces by GPBH mechanism. After the black holes evaporate completely, two disjoint dS spaces emerge. We excise small regions at the spacelike interfaces of de Sitter spaces and glue them together along the green lines so that an observer can move to a new de Sitter space within finite time.

Extended realization of a non sequential network to enforce the periodic boundary condition in the space variable $x_2$ according to \eqref{eq::per_base}. The periodic base layer is dependent on three parameters $\mathbf{B}, \mathbf{A}$ and $\phi$, which have an explicit dependency on the time $t$. These parameters and the input variable for which the output shall be periodic, $x_2$, serve then as input to the periodic base layer. The other input variables $x_1$ and $t$ are bypassed around the additional elements through a dense layer.
In the $3$-dimensional space, interconnected soft fibers do not disconnect the matrix. A simple case is depicted here: the cylindrical perforation $Q^0$ runs through the periodicity cell and its complement $Q^1$ is connected.
Illustrates where to deploy $P(v,n)$ the VFs (circles) of a remote driving application, the traffic routing (thick line), and robot-PoA attachment $\phi(r,R)$. Deployment, routing, and attachment decisions depend on contextual information as signal strength $\sigma_{R}(r)$ and link delays $d(w,n)$.
The model is solved by a rotated Jordan-Wigner transformation. Majorana bilinears that commute with the Hamiltonian are denoted by green dashed lines, which in turn form the static $Z_{2}$ variables. The solution is a Majorana hopping model, connected by orange and black lines, coupled with static $Z_{2}$ variables.

The dots represent the lattice $\Lambda$. Each blue rectangle is a fundamental domain for $\mathbb{R}^2 / \Lambda$. It can be identified with $\Sigma_t$ via the map $\Phi(t,\cdot,\cdot)$.
In standard perturbation theory, one gets approximations of the solution $\mathcal{F}(G)$ at a new point $G$ by using only the closest $G_j$ on which we know the solution $\mathcal{F}(G_j)$, while in multipoint perturbation we simultaneously use all the $G_j$'s on which we know the solutions.

The relevant elements are tabulated on the left while the copies of $P^{+}$ are depicted in different gray tones to indicate to which fundamental domain they contribute for the cases $I=\emptyset,\{s_{2}\},S$ (from light to dark). The $*$ in the last three columns indicates which elements are in $W^{I}$.

(a) We want to separate the black point from the white points. For this, we learn a DAC one-layer $f : \ensuremath{\mathbb{R}}^2 \rightarrow \ensuremath{\mathbb{R}}$. (b) DAC can learn a translation (DAC biases) that moves the leftmost point to the second quadrant (red line). (c) ReLU projects all points in the second quadrant onto the vertical axis (red line), making the dataset linearly separable. (d) DAC can now learn a direction (blue line) onto which to project the dataset. The black point is now separated from the white points.
This figure shows an example of the uniform grid at time $t=T-k\Delta t$, where the brown highlighted line corresponds to the boundary at $S=0$, the yellow to the boundary at $S=S_{max}$ and the green to the boundary at $q=0$.

\textbf{Isotropic hardening - LSTM versus SLSTM.} Prediction of a single load path using the return-mapping algorithm as a reference, the standard LSTM and the spiking LSTM formulation.
Given a square like the one on the left, the combination of a DAC layer $f:\ensuremath{\mathbb{R}}^2\rightarrow\ensuremath{\mathbb{R}}^2$ and a linear layer $g:\ensuremath{\mathbb{R}}^2\rightarrow\ensuremath{\mathbb{R}}$ can have positive values inside and negative outside, being able to separate the blue and orange points on the right. In fact, let $[f(x)]_i=\sum_{j=1,2}\,w_{ij}\varphi(b_{ij}+x_j)$ with $\varphi$ denoting ReLU, then it is enough to set $w_{ij}=1$, $b_{1j}=1$, $b_{2j}=0$ and $g(y)=y_1-2y_2-1$ to get $g(f(x))=\varphi(1+x_1)+\varphi(1+x_2)-2\varphi(x_1)-2\varphi(x_2)-1$, which equals $1-|x_1|-|x_2|$ inside the square and is negative outside. On the contrary, it is easy to see that if $f$ was a standard fully connected layer, then for all choices of $f$ and $g$ the set where $g(f(x))\geq0$ would always be unbounded or empty.
Logarithmic plots of $\|v_{N, h}(T)\|^2 + \|w_{N, h}(T)\|^2$ vs. $\|u_h^*\|_{L^2(L^2(\Omega);0,T)}$ vs.$y = x^{-3/2}$ using Alg. 1.

Aggregated results for the partial observability experiments with both occlusion types. For the experiments, except for the reward-only baseline, we used $20$ seeds per task. Both approaches clearly perform better than the reward-only baseline, showing that they can extract useful information from the occluded images. Yet, especially in the wall-occlusion task, the \emph{VRKN}-based agents outperform the \emph{RSSM}-based agents. They do not only achieve a higher reward but also converge faster. Especially in the wall occlusion task, it is insufficient to only extract information from the occluded images, but a reasonable belief also needs to be sustained over time.
We decompose the $t$-PNG model in any rectangle into a sequence of down-right paths. To distinguish between them, we give them different colors (this has nothing to do with the colored model). We label them $P_1, P_2$ and $P_3$. As shown in Figure \ref{fig:def-qpng}, these down-right paths play the role as level lines of the $t$-PNG height function.

\sl Schematic representation of the range of validity of the series expansions (\ref{DefSeriesExpansion}), which defines the scale $d_c=1/u_c$. We have introduced the variable $u(z)=1/d(z)$. {Furthermore, we have also included the coordinate $z_A$ (along with the distance $d_A=d(z_A)$ and $u_A=1/d_A$) beyond which we assume the Einstein equation (\ref{EQT}) to hold, as explained in Section~\ref{Sect:EnergyMomentum}.} Finally, in case of the metric representing a black hole, the figure also shows its position relative to the range of validity of~(\ref{Functionsfh}).
The graph $G(5,6,\vec{a},\vec{b})$ with $\vec{a} = (0,0,1,2,2)$ and $\vec{b} = (5,5,6,6,7)$. The black vertices belong to $G(5,6)$, but not $G(5,6,\vec{a},\vec{b})$. The graph $G(5,6,\vec{a},\vec{b})^\circ$ is obtained by removing all the isolated vertices.

A high level view of our approach: $x$ is the degraded input (colorization in this example) to the regression model. $x$ and $\hat{y}$ (the colorized image) serve as the input to the masking model which predicts the uncertainty mask $m$. The ground-truth image is denoted by $y$. With high probability, the distortion between the masked images, $y \odot m$ and $\hat{y} \odot m$ is low.
Approximation of the sign function using an odd polynomial. We use a polynomial of degree $\bigO(\frac{1}{\Delta} \log \frac{1}{\delta})$ to obtain a $\delta/2$-approximation of the sign function when $|x| \ge \Delta$. By increasing the degree we can increase both the accuracy of the approximation and the range. In amplitude amplification settings, the singular value we want to amplify usually sits close to $0$, and we want to transform it as close as possible to $1$.

\textbf{Table Tennis.} Model performance with 15 components, for an increasing number of minimum effective samples over ten random seeds and training-test selections. For small numbers of effective samples, the model specializes each component to very few training samples. The performance suffers as the context space is not appropriately covered. The dashed line indicates the point where the minimum number of components times the number of effective samples per component becomes larger than the total sample size. Approaching this threshold leads to the discussed degenerating behavior.

The function $R$ is in red. $H$, black, flattens the islands of $R$. When the islands are flipped up, we get $\widetilde R$ in green. The horizontal mirror image of this is the new blue function $B'$ on the right. Figures \ref{fig:integral 1}, \ref{fig:integral 2} give another example.
We consider a game with $2$ vertices. The curves represent the costs of the two vertices as a function of the mass on vertex $1$. There are three equilibria in this case: $x_1 = 0$, $x_1 = \gamma$ (second intersection of the costs curves) and $x_1=r$. Equilibria $x_1 = 0$ and $x_1 = r$ are strong; however $x_1 = \gamma$ is not strong, since a small quantity $\epsilon$ of mass can always move from $2$ to $1$ and improve its cost.

Adapted from \cite[Example 8.10.2]{Puterman:book}. While there is no optimal MD (memoryless deterministic) strategy, the following strategy is optimal for lim inf/lim sup mean payoff: Loop $\exp(\exp(k))$ many % $2^{2^k}$ times in state $s_k$ for all $k$. In this particular example, this can be implemented with either just a step counter or just a reward counter, but in general both are needed; cf.~\Cref{table:allresults}.

The dual graph for singularities relevant for 4d $\mathcal{N}=2$ SCFT. Notice that for the Coulomb branch configuration $(F, I_1^b)$, the property of the UV theory should be derived from the dual fiber $F^*$. The dual pairs in table.\ref{4ddeform1} are $(2II-0,2II^*-0),(2III-0,2III^*-0),(2IV-0,2IV^*-0)$. $2I_0^*-0$ is self-dual.
Strang splitting for SLIM operators for even number $N$ of sites: In each stage of the splitting scheme, only pairs of cores or single cores are altered. If no rank reduction is performed between these stages, the ranks of the resulting TT representation of $\Psi(t + \Delta t)$ are bounded by $r d^3$, where $r$ is the maximum TT rank of $\Psi(t)$.

Comparing the (normalized) marginal log-likelihood as a function of the leverage parameter $\rho$ in a stochastic volatility model. We plot the estimates as returned by an extended Kalman filter (red), a bootstrap particle filter (blue), and a Wasserstein-flow filter (green). The solid, dash-dotted, and dashed lines correspond to different number of observations $T=3000$, $T=1500$, and $T=750$, respectively. The true value is $\rho=-0.8$ (vertical line). The Wasserstein-flow and particle filter deliver consistent results independently of the data regime, while the extended Kalman filter does not.

A distinguished $(\omega+2)$-gon $\mathbb{P}({\bf{a}})$ (with the bold black arcs as the edges) represents a Yoneda $\omega$-extension $[{\bf{a}}]$ given in \eqref{eq:Myoneda}, which corresponds to a map in $\mathrm{Ext}^\omega(M_\alpha,M_\beta)$ arising from an oriented intersection ${\bf{a}}$ from $\alpha$ to $\beta$ with weight $\omega$.
The dotted lines in this diagram are edges in the fault set $F$ associated to $(u, v)$, and the solid black lines are edges in $H$ that are not contained in $F$. The dotted blue edge on the left is in $Z_v$, and the dotted yellow edge on the right is in $Z_u$. For clarity, we have omitted some (unfaulted) edges in this picture going between $C_u$ and $C_v$.

Accumulating the errors $\delta^\theta_t$ into $\Delta^\theta_t$. Each $\Delta^\theta_t$ is obtained from updating $\Delta^{\mathrm{prev}(\theta)}_{t-1}$. The red boxes and thick arrows show for example the ``correct path'' in which the index $\theta = \Theta(t)$ is proper at all time $t$. The ``correct path'' is expected to have the lowest values of both $\delta^\theta_t$ and $\Delta^\theta_t$.
\textbf{Typical Recommendation System Architecture:} The DLRM model~\cite{naumov2019deep} embeds each categorical feature separately and combines the resulting vectors with pair-wise dot products. Other architectures use different interaction layers or a single embedding table for all categorical features, but the central role of the embedding table is universal.
Reproduced Figure 1 of~\cite{OT08}. Each row of the qubits has the same number as the starting circuit. The number of rows is one more than the number of gates in the starting circuit. The $R$-th gate is performed on the $R$-th row and then all qubuts are swappwd with those in the $(R+1$)-th row. This lazy simulation of the circuit will ensure that each qubit is acted on by a gate at most three times.
Braiding between lines $W^{(1)}$ and $W^{(2)}$ from bulk ordering. We represented the lines $W^{(i)}$ by black points, the 3d twist sectors $D[\mathcal{T}_i]$ by red lines, the surfaces $U(\gamma)$ by blue lines, and the 4d condensation defects $V_i$ by green surfaces. Left: bulk definition of fusion. Right: two different ordering procedures, related by the half-braiding phase of the bulk 5d theory. In canonical quantization, time runs horizontally.
\centering For $n$ large enough the supports of $\omega_n^{(1)}$ and $\omega_n^{(2)}$, given by $B_{2M_n}$ and $\mathbb{R}^2\setminus B_{\frac{N_n}{2}}$, are disjoint. On $B_{M_n}$ and $\mathbb{R}^2\setminus B_{N_n}$ the functions $\omega_n^{(1)}$ and $\omega_n^{(2)}$ coincide with $\omega_n$, respectively.
Aggregated results in the missing observations setting with and without transition noise. First, we see that the \emph{VRKN} works equally well if we provide the information about which information are valid explicitly (\emph{VRKN}) or if we provide it by concatenation (\emph{VRKN (Cat)}). Second, the \emph{RSSM} performs significantly worse then both both \emph{VRKN} version. Especially if the system is subject to transition noise it fails to give good results.
(A portion of) the cellular decomposition of a 2-sphere made of faces glued along edges ({\it in black and thick}) and its dual graph $\Gamma$ ({\it in red and thin}) made of links and nodes. Each link $l$ is dressed with a spin $j_l$ and each node $n$ is dressed with an intertwiner $\iota_n$, which together represent a spin network $\Gamma_{\{j_l,\iota_n\}}$.

Performing filtering on a multi-modal dynamical system. We compare the filtering result of a particle filter (top) with that of a Wasserstein-flow filter equipped with a mixture of Gaussians posterior representation (bottom). Both filters capture the bi-modal state distribution (red and blue) induced by the true states (black) and their modulus observations (green).

$\Delta(2,2,\infty)$ is generated by two rotations, say $r_O$ and $r_{O'}$ of order $2$ about two distinct points $O$ and $O'$. It is an easy matter to check that $r_O\,r_{O'}$ is a translation of translation length equal to $2d_{\mathbb E^2}(O,\,O')$. Any shadow region is a fundamental domain for $W(2,2,\infty)$ whereas any infinite strip is a fundamental domain for $\Delta(2,2,\infty)$.

A graphical representation of the principle we use to distribute the vertices of $T$ for $(s,k)=(2,4)$ and in two dimensions. The figure shows the steps in the range $\{m',\ldots, m'+6\}$ (note that squares containing active vertices after step $m'+i$ contain only the index $i$ for reasons of space). Note that, for $\ell = 1$, the big square with thickened black boundary is the image of the small square $p$ with thickened black boundary by $\phi_1$, and the same holds for the corresponding red squares. Moreover, $c([0,1]^2)$, $c(p)$ and $c(\phi_1(p))$ are collinear and $\lVert c(p) - c(\phi_1(p))\rVert\leq\lVert c([0,1]^2) - c(\phi_1(p))\rVert = \sqrt{2}(1-s^{-1})/2$.
Comparison of upper bounds and conjectures on $\kappa_{2,2}^{(0)}(\tau)$ and $\kappa_{2,2}^{\sharp}(\tau)$ for various values of $\delta=N^{-\tau}$. Wooley's conjecture (Conjecture~\ref{conj:Wooley}) is identical to our Corollary~\ref{cor:mvt-weight-small d}, but applies only in the range $\tau \le 1/4$.
Neural implicit representations use fully connected layers with position encoding to represent a scene (a). Explicit voxel grids or hybrid variants using small implicit decoders are fast but scale poorly with resolution (b). Hybrid explicit-implicit TriPlane representation is fast and well scale, but we must train its parameters (c). In Hybrid explicit-implicit MultiPlane representation, we use existing images as a representation and use a small implicit decoder to aggregate information. By ref color, we marked trainable parameters of respected models. % \jacek{ja bym chyba dał klamry, przy naszym wejściu, i napisał, że oryginal representation}

The executed trajectories closely match the desired ones up to the context with the box, where the force required to push the box changes the trajectory. Note that \gls{vigor} learns from geometric descriptors of planned expert demonstrations and is thus able to compensate for the contact with the box.

After that, we have reached the final topology.

Empirical versus asymptotic summary statistics for $n_1 = 40, n_2 = 110, n_3 = 90, \beta_T = 1$ and varying $\beta_M$. Simulations are obtained by averaging over $10$ independent realizations of the random matrix $\rmZ$ and tensor $\tW$.

Comparison of the \emph{RSSM}, the simple smoothing extension (Smooth \emph{RSSM}) as well as versions of both models using Monte Carlo Dropout (MCD) to capture epistemic uncertainty in the dynamics (MCD-\emph{RSSM} and Smooth MCD-\emph{RSSM}). Note that we use different tasks for \emph{PlaNet} and \emph{Dreamer}-based agents. Thus the left and right plots are not directly comparable. For both types of agents, we find that proper inference by smoothing deteriorates performance. The additional epistemic uncertainty does not compensate for this decrease in performance.

Conditional on the drug being taken, her belief changes to $\nu$.}
An example of the graph representation of an ordered configuration. We have $n(\{j,j\})=2$ and $n(\{k,\ell\})=4$ and each edge is labeled (and thus colored) by a matrix from $\mathbf{A}.$ For this graph, the ansatz observable is given by $F(\x,\mathbf{A})=\frac{2}{27N^3}\langle A_1A_2\rangle\left(\langle A_3 A_4\rangle\langle A_5 A_6\rangle+\langle A_3 A_5\rangle\langle A_4 A_6\rangle+\langle A_3 A_6\rangle\langle A_4 A_5\rangle\right)$

The original vertex on the left has the Eulerian cycle passing left to right, and bottom to top, through the vertex. The four right-hand vertices are the possible results of an RV move on the vertex. For each of these cases, the dotted arrows show how the Eulerian cycle now passes around the vertex after the move.

The CDRNN forward pass for generating one prediction. Scalars are shown as circles, vectors are shown as narrow boxes, matrices are shown as wider boxes, and deep neural network transformations are shown as arrows. Computation proceeds in three stages (bottom-to-top): (i) processing the inputs, (ii) applying the impulse response, and (iii) convolving the impulses with the IRF (convolution weights) over time to generate a parameterization for the predictive distribution over the response.

The NEC, SEC, WEC and DEC are satisfied in the coloured region, which is divided into two regions (blue and green) by the line $\gamma_1=\omega_1/2$ that indicates isotropy to leading order. The red line $\gamma_1=\omega_1$, designates the vanishing of the leading order term and conditions for subleading coefficients become important.

The periodic map on genus zero component is $\bm{1}+\frac{1}{l}+\frac{l-1}{l}$, and on the genus one component is $\bm{\frac{3}{4}}+\frac{3}{4}+\frac{1}{2}$ (we take $E_7$ for an example, and other cases are similar).

It can be seen, that some outliers have large error values, resulting in a mean error over all samples of $8.7934 \times 10^{-2}$. Most samples have a significantly lower error.

Three main tasks typically associated to \emph{iris segmentation}: 1) parameterization of the pupillary (inner) boundary; 2) parameterization of the scleric (outer) boundary; and 3) discrimination between the unoccluded (noise-free) and occluded (noisy) regions inside the iris ring. Such pieces of information are further used to obtain dimensionless polar representations of the iris texture, where feature extraction methods typically operate.
Illustration of the macroelements $M_K^1$ and $M_K^2$ for the red highlighted mesh element $K \in \mathcal{T}_h$. For decreasing $h$ the macroelement shapes can be approximated by affine transformed squares. This observation together with the possibility of a covering of $\Omega$ by use of the macroelements yields the basic idea for the reduction of a global inf-sup condition to a localized version.

Sketch of the geometric setting of SW in GCC~\eqref{eq.baldauf}. The gravitational field $\mathbf{g}$ defines an equipotential surface $\mathcal{M}$. Thus, this surface is the manifold over which the problem is solved and it is fully described by the frame of GCC $\mathbf{x}=(x^1, x^2)$. The bathymetry is given by the bottom surface $b$, eventually discontinuous (meshed black surface). The free surface $\eta$ of the fluid is the blue surface. Consequently, the fluid depth $h$ is the length of the gravitational field line conducted from the free surface $\eta$ up to the bottom $b$. The velocity $\mathbf{u} = (u^1, u^2)$ of the fluid is computed along the tangent plane of the manifold $\mathcal{M}$ and measured along the principal directions given by the GCC $\mathbf{x}$.

\rm\small The partition of the positive chain $\cL_{7,5}$ with affine parameters $\rij=(7,5)$, into four critical curves and five Farey points (solid circles), determined according to theorem \ref{thm:CriticalCurves} i). Along the chain, all boundary words have length $\ri=7$. Above the line we have the critical words of the curves, and below the line the Farey fractions with corresponding boundary words [see theorems \ref{thm:CriticalCurves} ii) and \ref{thm:Words}]. The bottom row displays the critical words at the Farey points, all of length smaller than $7$, including the empty word $\varepsilon$ of zero length at $\theta^\pm$. The boundary word at a Farey point is the concatenation of a critical word and a periodic word, whose period is given by the denominator of the fraction.

Estimation of the differences between the forests. Differently from the figure, the radius doubles with decremented layer actually, except of the step from $k=hS_N{-}n{+}1$ to $k=hS_N{-}n$, where it quadruples. The left circles represent the new tower $\operatorname{tw} S_N$, the right circles the old tower $\operatorname{tw} S_M$. The set $w_N\setminus w_{N-1}$, which is added in the $N$-th round to the estimated forest, is estimated by the grey set, i.e.\only the\emph{lower} layers of $\operatorname{tw} S_M$, the large balls centred at $p_{S_M}$, are subtracted in the estimate, while the upper ones, the small non-concentric circles, are ignored.

Lifts of this graph are biregular graphs with two vertices of degree $m$ and $20m$ vertices of degree 3, which are all of girth 10 for $m \geq 6$. The two 4-cycles in the graph are highlighted.
Graphical representation of the transition rates among different species. These transitions are motivated by the cell cycle of {\it Caulobacter crescentus}, that either moves actively or settles down to reproduce. Our model contains three different species: the cells moving to the right $\rho_+$, those moving to the left $\rho_-$ and the settled ones $\rho_0$. The moving cells can either settle via the rate $\lambda_s$, move in the opposite direction with $\lambda_e$ or die with $\mu$. Settled cells duplicate via $\lambda_d$, and generate both a left- and a right-moving cell.

\footnotesize The shaded area corresponds to the range of boundedness afforded by Theorem \ref{thm:flat_surfaces}, that is, when the surface $\Sigma(Q_1,Q_2)$ is flat but $\det(s\nabla^2 Q_1 + t \nabla^2 Q_2)$ does not vanish identically. The critical lines given by \eqref{eq:mixed_necessary_conditions} and \eqref{eq:flat_surfaces_necessary_condition_1} are indicated: as one can see, the range of Theorem \ref{thm:flat_surfaces} is sharp when $2/q = 1/p$. The endpoint $\big(\tfrac{4}{d+4}, \tfrac{2}{d+4}\big)$ for the well-curved case is also indicated, and one can see that when $\Sigma(Q_1,Q_2)$ is flat all $L^p \to L^q$ estimates for $(1/p,1/q)$ close to this endpoint are false.
The $u$-iceberg container of a set $K$. Three iceberg-droplets are shown: the minimal $u_i$-iceberg droplet $J_i$ containing $K$ for each $i \in \{0,1,2\}$. Because $J_0$ is strongly connected to $\HH_{u_1}^d$ and $J_1$ is strongly connected to $\HH_{u_2}^d$, the $u_2$-iceberg container of $K$ is $(J_2,u_2)$.
In the reduction $\TILE\to\GSE$, (a) every tile $t_i$ is mapped to a spin state $s_i$. (b) Every (valid and invalid) tiling maps to a spin configuration. A tiling of size $n$ is valid iff the corresponding spin configuration is the ground state of $H_n$ with energy $0$.
This image provides a graphical expression of the mechanics of the primary domain described in Section \ref{sec:domain}. The junction location is shown at the bottom with a grey dashed outline in (10, 5). The arrows in (a) from the top row back to the start location represent teleportation back to the junction location when the agent takes an upward action off the top of the grid. The grey rectangle shown in (b) will represent the agent in later figures, and (b) also visually shows the six actions available to the agent from any location. For clarity, the target generation mechanics needed for the curiosity-recognizing module (not considered inherent to the domain) are shown separately in (c). The curiosity-generating location has a thick solid grey outline. The possible locations for curiosity targets to be generated, across the second row from the top, are highlighted in purple.

(a) The worldsheet diagrams that contribute to the amplitude of string states. (b) For an ordinary defect that couples to spacetime fields, such diagrams need to be summed. However, for fundamental strings, including such diagrams would lead to overcounting of the amplitude since the spacetime fields are supposed to emerge from string perturbation.
Proportion of incorrect proofs versus the type of the first error (i.e. non-canonical proof step), number of hops, and sentence ordering. The proof step types are detailed in figure \ref{fig:proof_step_types}. We note that in the 3-hop experiments with fictional ontology, four of the 400 examples surpassed the 2049 token limit for all models (except \textsc{InstructGPT} 175B version \texttt{002}). These examples were ignored (so the effective number of examples is 396). We omit the results for the 1-hop experiments here since there were too few incorrect proofs.
Gluing two copies of $\mathrm{HL}_{\epsilon}$ along the disk $\pi^{-1}(\hat{f})\subset \partial \mathrm{HL}_{\epsilon}\simeq T^2$. The set $\pi^{-1}(\hat{f})$ is shaded brown, and opposite pairs of boundary edges of the square are identified in the figure. The arrows on edges indicate the canonical lifts of the edges of the cubic graphs on $S^2$ to cycles in $H_1(\Lambda)$. External faces of the foam are labelled by the corresponding sign of the primitive function.

Visualization of the \textit{ProM}\optimization routine for the ACDC dataset with an acceleration factor of\texttt{x8} for a 2D mask. The \textbf{bottom row} shows our Bernoulli mask distribution $p_{\ensuremath{\bm{\theta}}}$, where a lighter color implies a higher probability for sampling the respective entry in the cartesian k-space grid. Starting from a randomly initialized distribution, \textit{ProM}\gradually optimizes$p_{\ensuremath{\bm{\theta}}}$ to maximize reconstruction quality while simultaneously increasing the sparsity of the masks. The resulting distribution converges to a domain-specific mask with desired acceleration factor that preserves most of the image's quality (\textbf{top row}). The original image is displayed on the \textbf{right}.
We can view an annulus in 2D as a 1D ``spin chain.'' The shown partition defines a spin chain over the ordered subsystems $\{ X_1, X_2, X_3, X_4, X_5 \}$.
A reachability game that, under any positive delay, is won by controller almost surely via the simple randomized strategy of coin tossing (thus randomly generating head and tail events $h$ and $t$), but won by player $O$ surely if interpreted as a delay game due to the lookahead on Player~$I$'s actions granted to Player~$O$. The initial state is marked by an arrow and controller wins if and only if the black vertex is visited at least once.

Different types of models and datasets considered in our experiments and their interactions. Dataset types are represented as green circles and model types are represented as blue rectangles. Text completion models can answer both types of datasets while QA engines can only answer MCQA datasets. However, MCQA datasets can be altered to fit into the Open QA category.
Feynman diagram that gives the dimension-5 effective up-type Yukawa operators in (\ref{eq:dim5yuk}), which themselves match onto the 1-3 and 2-3 up-type Yukawa couplings. The corresponding diagrams for down quark Yukawa operators can be obtained by trading every sub/superscript `$U$' for `$D$', and swapping $\tilde H$ for $H$.

\textbf{Cluster QR method in 3 steps.} In phase 1, each ID is hashed to a vector in each of 2 small tables (left), and the value (shown in the middle) is taken to be the mean of the two vectors. After, say, 1 epoch, the large (implicit) embedding table is sub-sampled and clustered. This leaves a new small table in which each of the IDs are represented by just one vector; and IDs that are ``semantically similar'' are represented by the same vector.

The tree built in $\mathcal{A}$ (Algorithm \ref{app:alg:Aheuristic}). Each node stores a unitary, the root at level 0 storing $\widehat{U}$. The edges are labeled by unitaries in $\widehat{\mathbb{V}_n}^{-1}$. A child node unitary is obtained by multiplying the edge unitary with the parent node unitary. The edges are grouped into hyper-edges, where each hyper-edge is labeled by a unitary in $\widehat{\mathbb{V}_{n,j}}^{-1}$. The nodes are grouped into hyper-nodes, where each hyper-node has a number indicating the number of $\widehat{R(P)}^{-1}$ in the path from the root to each node in this hyper-node. Within each hyper-node we select some nodes according to some criteria and the nodes in the next level are built from these selected (black) nodes.

Annotation of the source terms for example structure cells and their component sub-cells on uneven bed topography. $R$ represents a reaction force induced as a result of the uneven bed topography, $\tau$ represents a friction force acting at a layer interface, $z$ denotes the elevation above the bed and $h$ denotes the water depth in the sub-cell. $\textbf{U}_i$ is the vector of conserved variables for the $i$th whole cell, which is equal to the sum of the conserved variables for the component sub cells $\textbf{U}_{i,k}$.
Illustration of the above proof. In the orientation $\OO$, all edges on the arc $[i,k]$ are directed clockwise, and $k$ is a target. Such a vertex must exist because $i \orighta i+1$ and $j \orighta j-1$.

An example of part of a brane tiling with the action of $\varphi$. Let $\varphi$ send the part of the brane tiling on the left to the part on the right. Take the generators of the orbits to be $a,\,b,\,c,\,d$ and write $p_i$ for the path in $\m CQ'$ made of isomorphism arrows between the vertices $i$ and $\varphi(i)$. Hence $\xi(\varphi(a)) = p_2 a p_1^{-1}$, $\xi(\varphi(b)) = p_3 b p_2^{-1}$, $\xi(\varphi(c)) = p_4 c p_3^{-1}$, and $\xi(\varphi(d)) = p_1 d p_4^{-1}$. Therefore $\xi(c_{\varphi(v)}) = \xi(\varphi(d)) \xi(\varphi(c)) \xi(\varphi(b)) \xi(\varphi(a)) = p_1 dcba p_1^{-1} = p_1 \xi(c_v) p_1^{-1}$ and all the intermediary paths of isomorphism arrows cancel, as required.
moving a local charged operator past $U_g(\Sigma)$ will replace that operator with the action of the group on that operator. If there are no more operator insertions at earlier times, we can remove $U_g(\Sigma)$ from the right hand side.
The position of hot (red) and cool (blue) points $b_j$ of discrete spectra, relative to the spectral bands $[e_3,e_2]\cup [e_1,\infty)$ of the elliptic background. These can be viewed as the degeneration of small bands---centered at each discrete spectral point---on a higher genus surface.

Hierarchical structure of the rig. Arrows indicate inheritance from parent to child. gray, green and blue nodes indicate rigid bones, pose-control and thickness-control nodes, respectively. Fingers are referred to with the first letter of their name.
This figure shows the estimated value of the curiosity-inducing location (blue) and target locations (orange) over time for all thirty trials for each ablation and for the original Algorithm \ref{alg:sc}. Panel (f) shows the same data as Figure \ref{fig:results-lineplot}. In the directedness ablation (a), both the curiosity-inducing locations and targets grow over time, with large variation. When cessation when satisfied is ablated (b), the values of both the curiosity-inducing location and the targets remain constant over time, with the value of the curiosity-inducing location reaching $0.315$ during the agent's first and only visit to the curiosity-inducing location at time $t=0$ and the value of the targets remaining $0$ throughout. The learned value for the ablations of voluntary exposure (c) and aversive quality (d) remains zero everywhere. When aversive quality is replaced with positive quality (e), the learned values for the curiosity-inducing location and the targets are similar to those in the original algorithm, but the value of the curiosity-inducing location grows slightly more quickly over time.

An example illustrating how the second group of deviant strategies causes slowdown: on the left is the initial state, the deviant pool has a lead of 2 blocks ($B_{d1}$ and $B_{d2}$), both of which are unpublished. When an honest miner successfully mines a block, the deviant pool publishes its blocks, causing the block mined by the honest miner to be discarded, resulting in a slowdown.
By \Cref{qmuneqlambda} the starting point of a non-swappable edge in the $\alpha_2$-direction must lie in the red or in the orange region. We further show in \Cref{mu1<lam1} that actually a starting point of a non-swappable edge can only be in the red region.

For arbitrary $N = 2^n$ qubits and $n$ layers, the $l$-th course-graining layer (CG in the figure) is as in the qTTN ansatz whilst the $l$-th disentangling layer is a composition of the $(l-1)$-th disentangling layer with additional $R^{(j_1,j_2)}_X R^{(j_1,j_2)}_Z CNOT$ acting on adjacent pairs of the newly added qubits $(j_1,j_2)$ within that layer (e.g.\in the last disentangling operation above the last CNOT gates act on qubits$(2,4)$ and $(6,8)$ which were added on the last layer of the qMERA).

Here we illustrate the test spectrum of the relative majorization semiring $S^2$. It corresponds to the set of R\'{e}nyi divergences as is shown in the proof of Corollary~\ref{cor:RelativeMaj}, which is here drawn as the two-point compactification of $\R$. On the right-hand side of the centre point $\alpha=1/2$ (in black), we have the divergences $(p^{(1)},p^{(2)})\mapsto D_\alpha(p^{(1)}\|p^{(2)})$, and on the left-hand side of the centre point, we have the divergences $(p^{(1)},p^{(2)})\mapsto D_\alpha(p^{(2)}\|p^{(1)})$. Points $\alpha=0,1$ (in blue) correspond to the two essential derivations which are simply the Kullback-Leibler divergences with the two different orderings of its arguments, and the points $\alpha=\pm\infty$ (in red) correspond to the divergence $D_\infty$ with the two different orderings.

One can see that if $\X=(-3,-1)\uplus (1,3)$ and $\Xg(\gamma)=\{X'_1,X'_2,X'_3\}$ is as figured, then $\mathcal N(X'_1,\Xg(\gamma))=\{X'_2\}$, $\mathcal N(X'_2,\Xg(\gamma))=\{X'_1\}$ and $\mathcal N(X'_3,\Xg(\gamma))=\{X'_2\}$. %Hence, $\tD=\{(X'_3,2)\}$, which induce a constant label $2$ on all $\X$. %

\baselineskip8pt For an MDP with state space $S_H\times S_K\times S_M$, suppose that its unique optimal policy partitions $\R^3$ into four disjoint decision regions by a vertical plane and a horizontal plane. Both actions $W$ and $T$ are optimal over two disconnected regions. However, all three types of control limit optimal policies exist.
System overview of the malware analysis laboratory. The files to be analysed, in this case Windows PE files, are submitted to CAPE Sandbox and VirusTotal (VT) by separate Python scripts. After the analysis is complete, one script extracts and saves the CAPE reports and another performs the same action for the VT reports. From there the compile script processes all results by extracting the relevant information such as API calls and labels and compiles all this data into the multiple batches seen in the final dataset.

\small On the left, we depict the lower half of the Euclidean geometry combined with the subsequent Lorentzian evolution. The former %of the Euclidean geometry is used to generate the deformed thermofield initial state. The right figure illustrates the full Euclidean evolution which may be used to compute the normalization factor $Z$ or the thermal expectation value (vev) of operators with an appropriate insertion of operator $O(t)$.
Aggregated results in the fusion setting with and without transition noise. When comparing to \autoref{fig::eval_missing} we see that both approaches are able to exploit the additional proprioceptive information and improve their performance. Yet, the \emph{VRKN} seems to better exploit and accumulate the available information, as the resulting agents significantly outperform their \emph{RSSM}-based counterparts.
