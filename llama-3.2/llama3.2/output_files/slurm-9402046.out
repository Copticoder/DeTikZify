This is a picture of a scientific figure  as well as its caption. The caption reads: '\small{For a solution in $Q_1$, we prove Hölder continuity \ref{thm:holder} in $Q_{\frac{1}{2}}$. The Intermediate Value Lemma \ref{thm:IVL} relates $Q_{r_0}$ to $Q^-_{r_0}$ in the past. The Weak Harnack inequality \ref{eq:weakH} relates $Q_{\frac{r_0}{2}}$ with $\tilde Q^-_{\frac{r_0}{2}}$ and the Not-so-Strong Harnack inequality relates $Q_{\frac{r_0}{4}}$ with $\tilde Q^-_{\frac{r_0}{4}}$ in the past. Note that all cylinders depend on the value of $s \in (0, 1)$.}'. Generate LaTeX code that draws this scientific figure using TikZ. Ensure that the LaTeX code is self-contained and does not require any packages except TikZ-related imports. Make sure the TikZ code accurately reflects the image details as much as possible. Make sure the Tikz code compiles with no errors and is syntactically correctMake sure the output is not more than 500 wordsDon't forget to include \usepackage{tikz}! Return your result in a ```latex code block.

The image depicts a diagram with multiple rectangles and labels, which appears to represent a mathematical concept or theorem. The diagram consists of several rectangles of varying sizes, each with a label and a dashed line connecting them.

To create this diagram using TikZ, we can use the following code:

```latex
\documentclass{article}
\usepackage{tikz}

\begin{document}

\begin{tikzpicture}[scale=2]

% Define the rectangles
\draw[fill=blue, opacity=0.3] (0,0) rectangle (1,1);
\draw[fill=blue, opacity=0.3] (0.5,0.5) rectangle (1.5,1.5);
\draw[fill=blue, opacity=0.3] (0.75,0.75) rectangle (1.25,1.25);
\draw[fill=blue, opacity=0.3] (0.875,0.875) rectangle (1.125,1.125);

% Draw the dashed lines
\draw[dashed] (0,0) -- (1,0);
\draw[dashed] (0,1) -- (1,1);
\draw[dashed] (0.5,0.5) -- (1.5,0.5);
\draw[dashed] (0.5,1.5) -- (1.5,1.5);
\draw[dashed] (0.75,0.75) -- (1.25,0.75);
\draw[dashed] (0.75,1.25) -- (1.25,1.25);
\draw[dashed] (0.875,0.875) -- (1.125,0.875);
\draw[dashed] (0.875,1.125) -- (1.125,1.125);

% Add labels
\node at (0.5,0.5) {$Q_1$};
\node at (0.75,0.75) {$Q_{\frac{1}{2}}$};
\node at (0.875,0.875) {$Q_{\frac{r_0}{2}}$};
\node at (0.875,0.875) {$Q_{\frac{r_0}{4}}$};

\end{tikzpicture}

\end{document}
```

This code defines the rectangles and dashed lines using the `draw` and `fill` commands, respectively. The `node` command is used to add labels to each rectangle. The `scale` option is used to adjust the size of the diagram.

Note that this code assumes that the rectangles are all the same size and are positioned at the same coordinates. If the rectangles are of different sizes or are positioned at different coordinates, the code will need to be modified accordingly.
