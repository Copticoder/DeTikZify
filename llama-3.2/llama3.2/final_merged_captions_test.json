The entire network is enclosed within a dashed red rectangle labeled \"Extracted Network.\" The weights on the edges are represented as fractions or sums of fractions, such as \\(1\\), \\(1/2\\), \\(7/2 + 1/4\\), etc. Additionally, there are numerical values outside the network indicating some form of calculation or result, such as \\(-5 \\rightarrow 0.5\\) and \\(-6.5 \\rightarrow -0.375\\).\n\nTo create this diagram using TikZ, you would need to:\n1. Define the nodes and their positions.\n2. Draw directed edges between the nodes with appropriate labels.\n3. Enclose the network within a dashed red rectangle and label it.\n4. Include the numerical values outside the network.\n\nHere is a basic structure of the TikZ code to get you started:\n\n```latex\n\\documentclass{standalone}\n\\usepackage{tikz}\n\\begin{document}\n\\begin{tikzpicture}\n    % Define nodes\n    \\node (i1) at (0,2) [circle, draw] {$i_1$};\n    \\node (i2) at (0,0) [circle, draw] {$i_2$};\n    \\node (x1) at (2,2) [circle, draw] {$x_1$};\n    \\node (x2) at (2,0) [circle, draw] {$x_2$};\n    \\node (x3) at (4,2) [circle, draw] {$x_3$};\n    \\node (x4) at (4,0) [circle, draw] {$x_4$};\n    \\node (o1) at (6,2) [circle, draw] {$o_1$};\n    \\node (o2) at (6,0) [circle, draw] {$o_2$};\n\n    % Draw edges\n    \\draw[->] (i1) -- (x1) node[midway, above] {1};\n    \\draw[->] (i1) -- (x2) node[midway, above left] {1};\n    \\draw[->] (i2) -- (x1) node[midway, above right] {2};\n    \\draw[->] (i2) -- (x2) node[midway, below] {1/2};\n    \\draw[->] (x1) -- (x3) node[midway, above] {2};\n    \\draw[->] (x1) -- (x4) node[midway, above left] {-1/4};\n    \\draw[->] (x2) -- (x3) node[midway, above right] {3/2 + 5/4};\n    \\draw[->] (x2) -- (x4) node[midway, below] {1/2};\n    \\draw[->] (x3) -- (o1) node[midway, above] {7/2 + 1/4};\n    \\draw[->] (x3) -- (o2) node[midway, above left] {2};\n    \\draw[->] (x4) -- (o1) node[midway, above right] {8};\n    \\draw[->] (x4) -- (o2) node[midway, below] {1/",
        "This image depicts a directed graph with nodes and edges, representing a network.

Each edge is directed and annotated with weights or values. The nodes \\(i_1\\) and \\(i_2\\) have outgoing edges to \\(x_1\\) and \\(x_2\\), and \\(x_1\\) and \\(x_2\\) have outgoing edges to \\(x_3\\) and \\(x_4\\). Finally, \\(x_3\\) and \\(x_4\\) have outgoing edges to \\(o_1\\) and \\(o_2\\). The edges have labels such as \\(1\\), \\(2\\), \\(3\\), \\(7/2\\), and others, indicating weights or values associated with the connections. Additionally, there are annotations outside the dashed rectangle, such as \\(-5 \\rightarrow 0.5\\) and \\(-6.5 \\rightarrow 0.375\\), which might represent transformations or additional information related to the network."
